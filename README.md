# NJSQL

NJSQL is a lightweight JSON-based database management system (DBMS) with SQL-like querying capabilities, implemented in Java. It aims to provide a simple yet powerful way to store, query, and manage data using a custom binary JSON format called NSON (Not Just JSON).

## Key Features

- Data storage optimized using the NSON binary JSON format.
- Support for basic SQL commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- Git-inspired data synchronization with clone and push commands.
- User authentication and permission management.
- Command-line interface with easy-to-use syntax.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Phucvohoai/NJSQL.git
