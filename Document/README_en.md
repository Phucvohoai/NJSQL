# 🗂️ NJSQL - Not Just SQL

**NJSQL** is a lightweight, custom-built database engine written in **Java** that uses **JSON files** to store data, while allowing developers to interact with the database using **SQL-like commands**.

Ideal for developers who want to simulate SQL operations without setting up heavy systems like MySQL or SQLite.

---

## 🚀 Features

- SQL-style query support (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- Stores all data in human-readable JSON files
- User management system with **permissions**
- CLI interface with command history
- Fully offline and runs on `localhost:2801`

---

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
- Java JDK 23
- Windows / Linux / macOS

### How to Run
```bash
# On Windows
run.bat

# On Linux / macOS
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

> Once started, you'll enter the **NJSQL CLI**:
```
>> Welcome to NJSQL (Network JSON SQL)
>> Type /help for commands. Type /exit to quit.
NJSQL>
```

## 🔐 User System

### 👤 Creating a User
```bash
/cre user
```
- The first user created is an **admin**
- Subsequent users are **child users** under the admin

### 🔑 Logging In

/login
```

### 🚪 Logging Out
```bash
/logout
```

## 🛡️ Permissions

Only admin users can assign/revoke permissions.

### Grant Permission

/grant
```

### Revoke Permission
```bash
/revoke
```

## 📘 Supported SQL Syntax

| SQL Command                       | Required Permission |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| CREATE DATABASE <name>           | CREATE_DB           |
| USE <database_name>              | -                   |
| CREATE TABLE ...                 | CREATE_TABLE        |
| INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)     | INSERT              |
| DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...        | DELETE              |
| UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...     | UPDATE              |
| SELECT * FROM ...                | SELECT              |
| DESCRIBE <table_name>            | SELECT              |
| ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...   | ALTER_TABLE         |

## 📂 Data Storage Structure

NJSQL stores data under `njsql_data/<user_name>/`:

```
njsql_data/
└── <user_name>/
    ├── users.nson
    └── <database>/
        └── <table_name>.nson
```

- `.json`: Contains actual table data
- `_schema.json`: Defines the table's structure and constraints

---

## 🧪 Usage Example

```bash
/cre user
# → Username: admin, Password: admin123

/login
# → Username: admin, Password: admin123

/cre user
# → Username: dev, Password: dev123

/grant
# → Permission: CREATE_DB
# → User: dev

/logout
/login
# → Username: dev, Password: dev123

/sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
USE test;
CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "Alice");
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- Users **cannot perform actions** they don't have permission for.
- Direct modification of JSON files is **not recommended**.
- JOIN, GROUP BY, and complex WHERE conditions are not yet supported.

---

## 🛠️ Future Development

- Web-based GUI Admin Panel
- Indexing and performance improvements
- Support for JOINs and subqueries
- RESTful API layer for web integration

---

## 💡 Why NJSQL?

NJSQL is designed to **simplify database interactions** in educational projects, prototyping, or systems that need lightweight storage without external dependencies.
